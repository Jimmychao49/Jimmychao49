Hey everyone! My name is jimmy and welcome to my github page :)
I upload most of my programming work from Universiteit Leiden on here as a diary sort of, and wish to work on personal projects like website building and app developing on here
in the future too! 

I like working in C++ and wish to learn even more in HTML/CSS/JS for personal web development!
I am currently doing my bachelor Computer Science in Universiteit Leiden and would love to find new inspirations and tips on how to get a better workflow going.
If you like my work and want to collaborate on projects in the future you can always reach me via my mail: jimmychao49@gmail.com

And for the rest, stay true to yourself, no matter what :))
